## READ ME ##
A program I wrote in Rust to get the hang of the language. It uses the piston library to visualize the [sieve of eratosthenes algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) to sort out primes in a range. For now the screen is locked to the resolution 1920x1000 with a range of 1-1920. In the future I *might* modify it to allow multiple ranges, sizes, and the sum of the primes in a range.

## TODO ##
- Probably should add some lifetimes
- Reduce the amount of copying being done
- Figure out how to stop screen rendering without the continue_rendering flag
- Write some tests
